// This software package is designed to help interop between legacy C programs
// and go programs.
// If a primarily C program needs to call a utility function that is only
// available in go, this tool can assist with interop. In essence this package
// lets you call golang functions from C if the go functions take in simple byte
// arrays as input. See the docs in the toplevel for more detailed information
